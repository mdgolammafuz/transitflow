# --- Basic Configuration ---
# Specifies where tests are located and naming conventions
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*

# --- Execution Defaults ---
# -v: Verbose output
# --tb=short: Cleaner tracebacks
# --strict-markers: Fails if an unregistered marker is used
# --strict-config: Fails if pytest.ini has errors
# --asyncio-mode=auto: Automatically handles async test functions
addopts = 
    -v 
    --tb=short

# --- Path Configuration ---
# Ensures the root directory is in PYTHONPATH so 'spark.' and 'scripts.' imports work
pythonpath = .

# --- Test Markers ---
# Categorizes tests for targeted execution (e.g., pytest -m unit)
markers =
    unit: Fast, isolated tests with no external dependencies (Mocked data).
    integration: Tests requiring active services (Postgres, MinIO, Redpanda).
    spark: Tests that specifically require a local Spark Session.
    slow: Tests that take more than 1 second to run.

# --- Warning Management ---
# Standardizes output by hiding known harmless third-party deprecations
filterwarnings =
    ignore::DeprecationWarning
    ignore::PendingDeprecationWarning
    ignore:Subprocess.*:ResourceWarning

# --- Logging (Internal Pytest) ---
# Useful for debugging test failures in CI/CD
